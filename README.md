Well this project is attempting to solve that.  It creates pages, adds js libs, and is a complete standalone to the app you are building
with the ability to shutdown either the app or the dashboard and reconnect.  You can make a binary of your app and delete the dashboard and it will
not affect the app.  You can redownload this dashboard and reconnect the app even.  You can change 90% of the code of your app and it will still work this way.
