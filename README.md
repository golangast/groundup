Well this project is attempting to solve that.  It creates pages, adds js libs, file watches, and is a complete standalone to the app you are building
with the ability to shutdown either the app or the dashboard and reconnect.  You can make a binary of your app and delete the dashboard and it will
not affect the app.  You can redownload this dashboard and reconnect the app even.  You can change 90% of the code of your app and it will still work this way.

My walkthrough of the project - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ue5ffwENvY

This project has not been tested on linux yet but i am presuming it would just be a change in shellout only which would be a few seconds.
